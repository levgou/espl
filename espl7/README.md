# Input/Output Redirection and Pipelines
## Motivation
In this lab you will enrich the set of capabilities of your shell by implementing input/output redirection and pipelines. Your shell will then be able to execute non-trivial commands such as
 `cat < in.txt | tail -n 2 | cat > out.txt`, demonstrating the power of these simple concepts.
