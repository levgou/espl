Extended System Programming Laboratory - CS B.Sc @ Ben Gurion University

It is extremely important for a student of computing to understand 
some of the machine-dependent aspects of computing. In this course 
we focus mostly on system programming principles, 
rather than on a particular programming language. The Labs will be done on a LINUX platform,
and we will use different programming languages, 
including: C, Assembly, Python, Shell scripting languages and more. 
The goal of the labs is to introduce issues in both low and high level system programming,
as well as techniques on how to learn needed information on demand.
